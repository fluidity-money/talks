			<li>
User signs transaction indicating they're auctioning fractional rights
			</li>
			<li>
Rollup takes transaction and puts it on mainchain, broadcasts it to
connected users on the rollup
			</li>
			<li>
User creates a hub, opens a connection with each trader
			</li>
			<li>
Traders transmit to the hub a signed commitment to buy an amount of an
asset (increasing higher to be guaranteed a slot)
			</li>
			<li>
User picks the highest bids and aggregates them, then generates a merkle
tree and a merkle root
			</li>
			<li>
Using the original rollup, the user uploads the merkle root, traders who
wish to redeem their asset can then upload an inclusion proof on-chain
to get their asset
			</li>
			<li>
User redeems bid amounts by sending to the mainchain each transaction
			</li>
